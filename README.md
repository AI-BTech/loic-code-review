## Legal and Ethical Considerations

DDoS attacks are illegal in most jurisdictions worldwide. Possessing, using, or distributing DDoS tools with malicious intent may lead to:

- Criminal charges
- Civil liability
- Academic or professional consequences

Always obtain proper authorization before performing any security testing on systems, and follow responsible disclosure practices.

## Alternative Approaches

For legitimate network testing, consider professional tools such as:
- JMeter
- LoadRunner
- Gatling
- Siege

These tools are designed for legitimate performance testing and are used by security professionals within legal and ethical boundaries.
